Network Security Project

--Python Version 3.13
 
A client-server connection where the client may be a raspberry pi that takes data from IoT devices or an authorized user that may read the data.
We want to implement:
-	A firewall that blocks all connection to the server apart from the client
-	Protected data transfert.
-	Communication channel between IoT devices and raspberry pi.
-	A security service increases the security level when sending, processing, storing, accessing information to prevent eventual security attacks

Security Services:
-   peer authentication
-   access control
-   confidentiality (encryption/traffic padding)
-   data integrity (hashing)
-   non repudiation (digital signature)


HOW TO WORK WITH THE FIREWALL

1. run the server
2. run the firewall
3. run the client
